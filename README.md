# Radix Shardz

Shardz is a revolutionary NFT mini game built on the Radix ledger. 1000 tokens can be shattered and bonded in an 
attempt to find the rarest shards

# Tutorial
Users can buy `Shardz` tokens and can swap 1 token for 1 raffle ticket. Once the raffle ticket is bought, the backend 
processes a transaction to randomly change the value of the raffle ticket and set its value to one of the `Shardz` tier.
Users can then swap their raffle tickets for actual Shardz NFT.

# Rarity tiers
| Shard Tier | Probability of Mint |
|------------|:-------------------:|
| Clear      |         38%         |
| Yellow     |         28%         |
| Orange     |         20%         |
| Blue       |         10%         |
| Scrypto    |         3%          |
| Radix      |         1%          |
